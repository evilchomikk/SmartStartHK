Scenario: Add two numbers
	Given the second number is 70
	When the two numbers are added
	Then the result should be 120

Scenario Outline: Subtract two numbers
	Given the first number is <x>
	And the second number is <y>
	When the two numbers are subtracted
	Then the result should be <result>
Examples:
| x  | y   | result |
| 50 | 70  | -20    |
| 90 | -10 | 100    |

Scenario Outline: Delta
	When I calculate delta from <x>,<y>,<z> as coefficients of the quadratic equation
	Then the equation has <result> real number solutions 
Examples: 
| x  | y   | z  | result |
| 1  | 2   | -3 | 2		 |
| 4  | 2   | 1  | 1		 |
| 2  | 1   | 2	|	0    |
